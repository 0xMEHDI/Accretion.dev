        <p>
          Hey there.
          <br />
          <br />
          I'm Mehdi, a Computer Science student at Aston University.
          I've long wanted to set foot into the world of Game Development
          and finally have a chance to take my first concrete step towards achieving just that.
          <br />
          <br />
          Over time I've come to love making games as much as I've loved playing them,
          and have thus made it my mission to teach myself as much as I possibly can to adequately prepare
          for what will hopefully be a thriving career as a Game Developer.
          <br />
          <br />
          I currently have experience working with:

            <br />
            Below is a collection of most my past and current projects.
            These are works that either always had a small scope or are ones I haven't yet completed to a satisfying degree.
            <br />
            Any project listed below will have an appended description citing key specific and was worked on by myself, outside any academic context
            unless otherwise specified.

                  The idea was to create a procedurally generated side scrolling dungeon crawler/roguelite.

                  These are only snippets, but I hope to soon build them up into a more complete project.

                      <br />
                      This demonstrates three movement states: walking, running and sprinting; each with different animations and effects on movement,
                      as well as a basic attack system that will be expanded upon to include aerial attacks and other weapons.

                      First of two snippets demonstrating the procedural level generation algorithm I implemented for the game.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      This is rougly based on Spelunky creator, Derek Yu's algorithm, as he described it in his book.

                      <br />
                      I've implemented the algorithm to generate levels on a grid of any desired size and allowing for any number of room templates to be added,
                      further increasing the variety between each and every level.

                  These three "games" were my first delve into the type of programming I knew I'd actually enjoy.
                  <br />
                  These were how I began familiarizing myself with the basic building blocks of most games;
                  namely movement, physics and collision systems, as well as some core concepts of game design.

                      <br />
                      <br />
                      This was my first ever game and as simple as it was, it served as good motivation to advance my learning.

                      <br />
                      This was my attempt at making a game with a proper 3D environment,
                      dealing with slightly more advanced collision detection, particles systems and UI.

                  The current showcase is that of an older version of the game. A newer one is currently in the works.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  This project was part of a year long assignment for a University module,
                  for which the requirement was to develop a strategy game of some kind.
                  It was worked on by a group of 4 team members including myself.
                  <br />
                  Our chief inspiration for the game was RimWorld but with a more hand crafted narrative experience.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Working on this has definitely brought about new experiences for me:

                      I've learned alot from my team members from a technical point of view. Each of us had their own interests
                      and levels of proficiency in different areas of programming, and the exposure to these has led me to put my own
                      ability in perspective and gauge it objectively.

                      I've familiarized myself with the usage of frameworks such as MonoGame, as well as external libraries such as Myra and GeonBit.

                      I've tackled a multitude of lower level features such as pathfinding, lighting, animations, serialization and UI;

                      I've also come to learn how to adapt to working within a team where not all team members share the same level of technical ability,
                      drive to create as well designed and fun a game as possible nor the will to make concessions for the sake of the project proceeding smoothly.

                  Currently my most completed game. After working my first platformer I realised I wanted to try a different approach to level design through procedural generation.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  The goal of the game is to survive an increasingly larger waves of enemies as they try to overwhelm you with numbers.
                  At the start of each wave, the arena is randomly generated based on a sizeable set of parameters, ensuring every run is unique in both layout and challenge.

                  This project has taught much about various aspects of game development, from both a programming and design point of view:

                  <ul style="line-height:22px">
                    <li style="margin:20px 0px">
                      Programming wise, I've had to tackle collision and enemy AI in a more involved way, as well as navmeshes, event subscriptions, coroutines
                      and some intersting techniques in the Fisher-Yates shuffle and floodfill algorithms.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Design wise, I've had to, for the first time, properly address issues of balancing by adding/removing features
                      to neither trivialize any challenge provided by the game, nor impede the player's ability to intuitively take control of the character.

                  This is was the first game I felt was, at least from a mechanics' point of view, fairly complete (short of a few kinks).

                  <br />
                  It currently only contains one level, but is relatively feature complete otherwise;
                  it uses physics simulation I implemented using Raycasting, leading to more accurate collision detection and tighter controls.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  The game features a simple but effective enemy AI, collectibles, along with some basic UI and sound effects.
