        <p>
          Hey there.
          <br />
          <br />
          I'm Mehdi, a Computer Science student at Aston University.
          I've long wanted to set foot into the world of Game Development
          and finally have a chance to take my first concrete step towards achieving just that.
          <br />
          <br />
          Over time I've come to love making games as much as I've loved playing them,
          and have thus made it my mission to teach myself as much as I possibly can to adequately prepare
          for what will hopefully be a thriving career as a Game Developer.
          <br />
          <br />
          I currently have experience working with:

            <b>— Snapshots from a potential side scrolling dungeon crawler</b>
            <b style="float: right">C# — Unity</b>
            <br />
            <br />
            This is an idea I've begun toying with the past couple of weeks.
            The idea was to create a procedurally generated side scrolling dungeon crawler/roguelite.
            <br />
            These are only snippets, but I hope to soon build them up into a more complete project.

                This demonstrates three movement states: walking, running and sprinting; each with different animations and effects on movement,
                as well as a basic attack system that will be expanded upon to include aerial attacks and other weapons.
                <br />
                <br />
                The player character being kinematic, it uses a rigidbody physics simulation I implemented from scratch using Raycasting techniques.

                This is rougly based on Spelunky creator, Derek Yu's algorithm, as he described it in his book.
                <br />
                I've implemented the algorithm to generate levels on a grid of any desired size and allowing for any number of room templates to be added,
                further increasing the variety between each and every level.

            <br />
            These three "games" were my first delve into the type of programming I knew I'd actually enjoy.
            <br />
            These were how I began familiarizing myself with the basic building blocks of most games;
            namely movement, physics and collision systems, as well as some core concepts of game design.

                This was my first ever game and as simple as it was, it served as good motivation to advance my learning.

                This was my attempt at making a game with a proper 3D environment,
                dealing with slightly more advanced collision detection, particles systems and UI.

                I will say however, that the project is even less complete than the previous two,
                as I'd lost interest after implementing my own DFS algorithm.

              <b style="float: right">C# — Unity</b>
              <br />
              <br />
              Currently my most complete game. After working on the platformer listed above,
              I realized that hand crafting levels wasn't something I found to be very enjoyable.
              That experience led me down the path of generating levels through code, which I found both challenging and rewarding.
              <br />
              <br />
              The goal of the game is to survive an increasing number of enemies per wave as they try to overwhelm you with numbers.
              At the start of each wave, the arena is randomly generated based on a number of preset parameters I setup,
              chief among which are map size and obstacle percentage.
              Each individual wave can spawn enemies in varying amounts and at a varying rate,
              with different health and/or speed values, ensuring every run is unique in both layout and challenge.
              <br />
              <br />
              This project has taught much about various aspects of game development, from both a programming and design point of view:
              <br />
              <ul style="text-align: justify; margin:20px; margin-top: 30px">
                <li>
                  Programming wise, I've had to tackle collision and enemy AI in a more involved way, as well as navmeshes, event subscriptions, coroutines
                  and some more advanced techniques like the Fisher-Yates shuffle and floodfill algorithms.
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                  Design wise, I've had to, for the first time, properly address issues of balancing by adding/removing features
                  to neither trivialize any challenge provided by the game, nor impede the player's ability to properly take control of the character.

              <b style="float: right">C# — MonoGame / XNA</b>
              <br />
              <br />
              This particular game is being actively and heavily worked on as you read this,
              so I'd like to point out that both this bit of text as well as the video demo above are very much subject to change.
              <br />
              <br />
              This project is part of a year long assignment for a University module,
              for which the requirement is to develop a strategy game of some kind.
              It is being actively worked on by a group of 4 team members including myself.
              <br />
              Our chief inspiration for the game is RimWorld but with a more hand crafted narrative experience.
              <br />
              <br />
              Working on this has definitely brought about new experiences for me, both positive and negative:
              <ul style="text-align: justify; margin:20px; margin-top: 30px">
                <li>
                  I've learned alot from my team members from a technical point of view. Each of us has their own interests
                  and levels of proficiency in different areas of programming, and the exposure to these has led me to put my own
                  ability in perspective and gauge it objectively.
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                  I've familiarized myself with the usage of frameworks such as MonoGame, as well as external libraries such as Myra and GeonBit.
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                  I've tackled a multitude of lower level features such as pathfinding, lighting, animations, serialization and UI;
                  as well as higher level ones, namely inventory systems, resources and crafting systems.
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                  I've also come to learn how to adapt to working within a team where not all team members share the same level of technical ability,
                  drive to create as well designed and fun a game as possible nor the will to make concessions for the sake of the project proceeding smoothly.

              <br />
              This is was the first game I felt was, at least from a mechanics' point of view, fairly complete (short of a few kinks).
              <br />
              <br />
              It currently only contains one level, but is relatively feature complete otherwise;
              it uses physics simulation I implemented from scratch using Raycasting, leading to more accurate collision detection and tighter controls.
              <br />
              The game features a simple but effective enemy AI, collectibles, along with some basic UI and sound effects.
